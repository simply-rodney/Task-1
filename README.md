### Project Overview

Global CO₂ Trends and Insights analyzes a decade of global CO₂ emissions data to reveal critical trends for policy and corporate action. This project highlights where emissions are rising or falling, identifies major contributing regions and sectors, and outlines key patterns in emission sources. The goal is to provide clear, actionable insights to support informed decision-making on reducing carbon footprints and addressing climate change.

### Data Sources

- Global Carbon Project (GCP):

Provides annual reports and datasets on global CO₂ emissions from fossil fuels, land-use changes, and more.

- Our World in Data (OWID):

Offers user-friendly datasets on CO₂ emissions by country, sector, and per capita, along with other environmental indicators.

### Tools

- Excel - Data cleaning
- MySQL - Data analysis
- PowerBI - Creating reports

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

In the initial data preparation stage , the following actions are performed:

1. Data loading and inspection
2. Data cleaning and formaatting

### Findings

Based on insights typically drawn from the data sources listed, here are some key findings regarding global CO₂ emissions trends over the past decade:

1. Increasing Emissions Despite Efforts
Global CO₂ emissions have continued to increase overall, despite growing awareness and international climate agreements. While some regions have seen slight declines, global emissions have generally trended upward.

2. Top Emitting Countries Remain Consistent
China, the United States, and India have consistently ranked as the top emitters. Together, these countries account for nearly half of global CO₂ emissions, driven by industrial activities, energy consumption, and population size.

3. Emissions per Capita Show Wide Variation
CO₂ emissions per capita vary significantly, with high-income countries generally having higher per capita emissions. However, some emerging economies, particularly those heavily dependent on fossil fuels, are seeing rapid increases in per capita emissions.

4. Shift Towards Renewable Energy Sources
Although fossil fuels remain the primary source of CO₂ emissions, there has been a gradual increase in renewable energy adoption, especially in Europe and parts of Asia. Renewable energy sources now represent a more significant share of the energy mix, helping to slow emissions growth in certain regions

### Recommendations

Based on the findings and trends typically observed in global CO₂ emissions data, here are some key recommendations for policy makers, corporations, and other stakeholders:

1. Accelerate Transition to Renewable Energy
Governments and corporations should invest more aggressively in renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydropower to reduce dependency on fossil fuels.
Rationale: The energy sector is the largest contributor to CO₂ emissions. By increasing renewable energy in the power grid, nations and businesses can significantly lower their carbon footprints.

2. Promote Energy Efficiency and Conservation
 Implement energy efficiency standards and incentivize energy-saving technologies for industries, buildings, and households.
Rationale: Reducing energy demand through efficiency measures (e.g., better insulation, LED lighting, energy-efficient appliances) is one of the quickest and most cost-effective ways to cut emissions.

3. Encourage Low-Carbon Transportation Solutions
 Expand public transit, promote electric vehicle (EV) adoption through subsidies, and improve infrastructure for non-motorized transportation (e.g., bike lanes).
Rationale: Transportation is a major source of emissions in many regions, especially in urban areas. A shift toward public and electric transportation would substantially reduce emissions from this sector.

4. Enhance Carbon Pricing Mechanisms
 Implement or strengthen carbon pricing mechanisms, such as carbon taxes or cap-and-trade systems, to encourage industries to reduce emissions.
Rationale: Carbon pricing can be an effective tool to internalize the cost of emissions and incentivize corporations to invest in cleaner technologies and practices.

### Limitations

Here are some key limitations that could affect the analysis of global CO₂ emissions data:

1. Data Gaps and Inconsistencies
   
 Data on CO₂ emissions is not always available or reliable for all countries, especially in developing regions where emissions reporting may be infrequent or lack standardized methodologies.

2. Time Lag in Data Reporting
 
 Emissions data is often published with a lag of one to two years, meaning the most recent trends may not be fully captured.

3. Exclusion of Certain Emissions Sources

 Most datasets focus on CO₂ from energy and industrial activities but may exclude other greenhouse gases (like methane and nitrous oxide) and sources (e.g., small-scale land-use changes).

### Conclusion

The analysis reveals that global CO₂ emissions have continued to rise, driven by energy demand, industrial growth, and urbanization, despite some progress in renewable energy adoption. To curb emissions effectively, countries must commit to stronger climate policies, invest in clean energy, and promote sustainable land use. Corporations and individuals also play crucial roles through transparent emissions tracking and adopting sustainable practices.

Reducing emissions requires coordinated action across all sectors. While challenging, swift and sustained efforts can mitigate climate change impacts and pave the way for a sustainable, resilient future.
